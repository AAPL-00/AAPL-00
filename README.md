### 🛠 What I’m working on

Right now, I’m deepening my knowledge in building REST APIs using **Django REST Framework** and **FastAPI**. I care about solid architecture, pragmatic design, and clean, expressive code that’s not just functional but readable and thoughtful.

My current focus: mastering backend design from data modeling to API layer, while keeping performance, maintainability, and real-world constraints in mind.

### 💻 Tech I work with

- 🐍 **Python** – My go-to language for its clarity and power.
- ⚙️ **Django / DRF** – To build structured, reliable systems.
- ⚡ **FastAPI** – For modern, async-friendly, high-performance APIs.
- 🐘 **PostgreSQL** – My preferred RDBMS for production use.
- 🐧 **Debian GNU/Linux** – Stability and control over my environment.
- ✍️ **Zed** and **VScode** – Depending on the day and the project.

### 🧠 Learning process

I’m not just learning tools—I’m reshaping how I think about systems, structure, and collaboration. I believe that building software is also about building clarity of thought. Every line of code is a decision, and I try to make mine conscious.

### 🤝 Let’s connect

I’m open to collaborations with people who value simplicity, purpose, and learning together. You don’t need the latest buzzwords to write great software—just care and craft.
